## In This website I used AWS S3 Bucket, AWS CLi and AWS SSL Validation along with HTML and JAVASCRIPT.
## In this website users can Upload videos and images into AWS S3 bucket.
## And used rest api to fetch the videos and Images to the Specific useres.(Just Like YOUTUBE and facebook)
```sh
[`sharp` library is used for image `resizing` or `processing`]
[The reason behind this is to look the image like tiktok video or instagram reels]
```

```sh
npx prisma studio //for seeing the data saved into the dataBase
```

```sh
# for private key
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048

```

```sh
# creating public key from private key
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

```
